This is my Capstone project for my Masters in Data Analytics in which I conducted a time series analysis projecting solar panel yields. The first part of the code comprises the cleaning and exploration of the data, and then progresses to fitting, as well as the time series algorithm itself.
The attached files include the open source data utilized and the code used for the analysis.
